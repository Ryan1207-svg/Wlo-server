# Wonderland Online Private Server & CheatEngine

A high-performance, modular private server emulator and cheat/administration engine for **Wonderland Online (WLO)** written in C# (.NET Framework 4.6.2). Engineered for **100% dynamic portability**, allowing zero-configuration cloning, building, and running across any Windows machine or drive.

---

## Key Features

- **100% Dynamic Portability**: Zero hardcoded absolute paths. Seamless path resolution across all workstations via `RCLibrary.Core.PathHelper`.
- **Self-Healing SQLite Database**: Consolidated single database in `Data/ServerDataBase.db` with 32 relational tables. Automatically verifies schemas, applies unique indexes, and seeds missing default data upon every boot (`GameDataBase.VerifySetup()`).
- **Tri-Server Socket Architecture**:
  - **Login Server (Port 6414)**: Authentication, account management, character selection/creation, Item Mall catalog sync (`AC 75`).
  - **World Server (Port 6415)**: Overworld replication, tile pathfinding, turn-based combat engine, quests, dialogue engine, housing.
  - **Status Service (Port 6416)**: Server cluster load indicator (Green/Yellow/Red/Auto), rates, player count broadcasting.
- **Complete 88 Action Code Protocol (AC 1 - AC 186)**: Full support for turn-based battles (`AC 11`/`AC 50`/`AC 51`), vehicle/mount system (`AC 15`), tent housing (`AC 12`), quests (`AC 39`/`AC 52`), and cinematic cutscenes (`AC 186`).
- **Authentic Asset Parsing**: In-memory decryption and caching of `Npc.dat` (4,928 NPCs via XOR `0x5209`), `Item.dat`, `Skill.dat`, `Talk.dat`, `Mark.dat`, and `Eve.emg` event scripts.
- **Comprehensive GUI Management Suite**: Live player monitoring, map inspector, NPC/Mob editor, quest manager, Item Mall studio, chest drop editor, and firewall security center.
- **Dynamic Ground Items Lifecycle (`AC 23`)**: Automatic map loading of native terrain resources from `Eve.emg` `ItemAreas` (209 items across 77 maps). Real-time authentic batched spawning (`AC 23:4`), terrain slot pickups (`AC 23:2`), gold item banner acquisition popups (`AC 23:6`), and asynchronous heartbeat respawning.
- **Robust NPC Spatial AI & Wander Boundaries**: Authentic signed bounding-box roaming (`WalkBehavior == 3`), waypoint patrol oscillation (`WalkBehavior == 2 / 5`), and static anchors (`WalkBehavior == 1`) preventing map boundary drift or corner teleports.
- **State-Verified Dialogue & Quest Safeguards**: Multi-event evaluation prioritizing post-quest resolution over completed stages, Quest State Condition decoding, and irreversible completion locks preventing quest demotion loops.
- **Authentic Starter Pack, Multi-Quantity Chests & Vehicle Lifecycle**: 8-piece authentic beginner equipment package (Notepad, Remote Control, Fugu Hot Pot x50, Tao Rice Ball x10, Protective EXP Pill x5, Bamboo Dragonfly, Holy EXP Potion x3, Training Ticket x5) occupying strictly 8/50 slots (42 free slots). Complete 1x1 bag inventory grid integrity, stackable item aggregation, bytecode-decoded multi-quantity chest loot (from `Eve.emg` opcode `dialog4 >> 8`), and guaranteed vehicle/raft inventory deletion and AC 23 synchronization upon shore wrecking or durability loss.
- **Graceful Shutdown & Diagnostic Countdown**: Non-immediate shutdown saves all player, inventory, and server data, displays the exact canonical log file location on the console, and executes a 10-second countdown with second-by-second updates before exit.
